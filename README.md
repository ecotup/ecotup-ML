# ecotup-ML
This repository for ecotup project focusing on Machine Learning and Python script, in this repository we have 3 model which is the trash classification softmax, trash classification sigmoid, and we also have a clustering model that fused with sorting algoritm especially using TSP Greedy Algorithm. For the Trash Classification Model we using the InceptionV3 transfer learning using Imagenet weight for more accurate prediction.


##Introduction
Machine learning is a computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data. With this technology almost any problem that humans have a hard time doing can be solved easily and it can make humans work much more easier. Our job as a machine learning developer in this Ecotup team is to make and give innovation that can make the app much more automatic, more efficient, can help user become better and much more satisfying to use.  
File list
- feature_python_dockerize = inside is fill with features that already been prepared using dockerfile that only need to build image then deploy using google run
- Model_Code = inside is fill with the model code that already succeeded
